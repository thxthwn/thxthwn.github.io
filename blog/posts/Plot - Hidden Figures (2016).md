In 1961, mathematician Katherine Johnson works in the segregated West Area Computers division at Langley Research Center alongside aspiring engineer Mary Jackson and unofficial supervisor Dorothy Vaughan. After a successful Russian satellite launch, pressure mounts to send American astronauts into space. Katherine is assigned to assist Al Harrison's Space Task Group, becoming the first African American woman on the team. She faces discrimination, especially from head engineer Paul Stafford. Meanwhile, Dorothy's request for a supervisor role is denied, and Mary pursues an engineering degree after identifying a flaw in the space capsule's heat shields. Katherine meets Army officer Jim Johnson, and they eventually marry.

Katherine impresses Harrison by solving a complex equation, gaining his respect. She faces challenges, such as a lack of bathrooms for "colored" people, which Harrison later rectifies. The Mercury 7 astronauts visit Langley, with John Glenn being cordial to the West Area Computers. Despite her contributions, Katherine is forced to remove her name from reports credited to Stafford. Mary wins a court case to attend an all-white school for her engineering degree. Dorothy learns the IBM computer could replace her team, so she masters FORTRAN, trains her coworkers, and becomes the supervisor of the Programming Department.

As John Glenn's launch nears, Katherine is reassigned but is called back to verify the IBM calculations, ensuring a safe re-entry. The launch succeeds, with Katherine's work proving crucial. Post-mission, Katherine is reassigned to the Analysis and Computation Division, Dorothy continues supervising programming, and Mary obtains her engineering degree. Katherine later calculates trajectories for Apollo missions, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, and the Langley Research Center renames a facility in her honor.
