# Class Reflection 2
- Weather and Geography aren't culture, but rather a factor creating cultures.
- Fashion trends, products, idols are also a part of culture.
- I learned that Western Culture core beliefs are mostly about sociopolitical ideologies like communism, marxism, etc. but Eastern core beliefs are mostly based out of Religions, ethics, etc.
- Drawing of the same countries can also differ between people, for example Me and one of my classmates chose switzerland as the country and there are still some differences in the drawing.
- While people share similarities through culture, differences in perspectives and thinking still exist, making each person unique
