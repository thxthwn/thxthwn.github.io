# Active Voice & Passive Voice (2024-10-20)
[**Transitive verbs**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/node/10383) have both **active** and **passive** forms:

| Active                                 | Passive                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| _The hunter **killed** the lion._      | _The lion **was killed** by the hunter._ |
| _Someone **has cleaned** the windows._ | _The windows **have been cleaned**._     |
Passive forms are made up of **the verb [_be_](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/node/1372)**Â with a [**past participle**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/node/1352):

| Subject     | be              | Past Participle | Adverbial           |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| English     | ***is***        | ***spoken***    | all over the world. |
| The windows | ***have been*** | ***cleaned.***  |                     |
If we want to show the person or thing doing the action, we use _**by**_:

> _She was attacked **by** a dangerous dog.  
> The money was stolen **by** her husband._

****
The passive infinitive is made up of _**to be**_ with a **past participle**:

> _The doors are going **to be locked** at ten o'clock.  
> You shouldn't have done that. You ought **to be punished**._

We sometimes use **the verb _get_** with a **past participle** to form the passive:

> _Be careful with that glass. It might **get broken**.  
> Peter **got hurt** in a crash._

We can use the **indirect object** as the **subject** of a passive verb:
