What can we do about the current state of social media

**3 Level of SNS Content**
1. trend jackers
	- low-quality content
	- least value 
	- creates instant gratification
	- doesnt create or adds up to one’s critical thinking
	The fix:
	- do something meaningful
	- read long stuff

2. The brilliant Nobodies
	- Cares so much authenticity
	- What they do really doesn’t mean anything
- The Fix
	- Dumb down ideas as a creative challenge
	- Get over that damn fear and do it

1. The Value creators
	- using social media as a tool for their work.
