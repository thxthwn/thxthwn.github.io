Visual Aids          | Using visual aids                                                                                                                                          | integrating various types of visual aids into their teaching make lessons more engaging and can improve student learning outcomes.                                                                                                      | If not used properly, **visual aids can be a source of distraction.** Creating or finding high-quality, relevant visual aids can be time-consuming for teachers. There's also the risk of using visuals that are culturally inappropriate or that reinforce stereotypes. |                                                                |
