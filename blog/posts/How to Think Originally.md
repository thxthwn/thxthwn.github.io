# How to Think Originally
**This does not apply only in writing, but also in other creative areas such as music, visual arts, coding, etc.**

## Consume Widely & Uniquely
Ideas come from somewhere else, consuming the same content does not create originality. The solution is simple; gather info that are more wide and unique.

## Allow time to think
<font color="#2DC26B"><center>If you want more original thoughts, stop consuming!</center></font>
Constantly consuming material without analyzing it properly is not going to be effective to our thinking process, similar how you go to the gym everyday without resting and seeing no results, because muscles are developed during when you rest, especially when sleeping. 

*Walking is a great way to get more creativity!*
## Live First, Create Later

Most creative works are inspired by the author’s past life experiences, and they express their thoughts and feelings through writing, through making music, or through painting. So you have to experience life
