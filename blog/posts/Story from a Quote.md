# Story from a Quote
 “You are the only person I'd like to say goodbye to when I die, because only then will this thing I call my life make any sense. And if I should hear that you died, my life as I know it, the me who is speaking with you now, will cease to exist.”

He spoke those words with a trembling voice as we sat on the old bench by the cliffside, our spot for years. Memories flashed through our minds—summer nights under the stars, winters spent warming our hands over coffee, and countless sunsets that seemed to last forever, even though we knew they wouldn't. Every moment we shared felt like borrowed time, and we both knew he didn't have much left.

The sun began its descent into the ocean, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange. We watched in silence, knowing this sunset, like all the others, would fade into darkness. Yet, tonight, it lingered a little longer, as if the universe was giving us this one last beautiful moment.

"Promise me something," he said, breaking the silence. "Don't let this place become just a memory when I'm gone. Come here, watch the sunsets, and remember me with joy, not sadness."

"I promise," I replied, my voice steady but full of emotion. "But you have to promise me something too. Promise me that wherever you are, you'll send me a sign, something to let me know you're okay. I can't afford to live without even a piece of you."

Years passed, and I returned to the cliffside every year on that same day, now watching the sunset alone. One day, as I sat there, a seagull landed on the bench beside me. It looked at me with curious eyes, and in that simple moment, a warmth spread through my chest. I smiled, remembering what he said, knowing he had kept his promise too.

“You are the only person I'd like to say goodbye to when I die, because only then will this thing I call my life make any sense. And if I should hear that you died, my life as I know it, the me who is speaking with you now, will cease to exist.”
