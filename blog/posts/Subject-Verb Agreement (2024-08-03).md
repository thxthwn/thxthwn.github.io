# Subject-Verb Agreement (2024-08-03)
Subject-Verb agreement refers to the fact that the subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number. In other words, they both must be singular or plural.

## 10 Rules of SV Agreement
**Rule #0** - A singular subject takes a singular verb, whereas a plural subject takes a plural verb.

E.g.
- The list of items is on the desk
- My brother is a nutritionist
- My sisters are mathematicians
### **Rule #1** - Use a plural verb with two or more subjects when they are connected by <u>and</u>. 

E.g.
- A car and a bike are my means of transportation.
- The creator and producer is arriving soon. (both refer to the same person.)
**<u>Exceptions</u>:
- Breaking and entering is against the law
- The bed and breakfast was charming.
those sentences are compound nouns.
### **Rule #2** - Use a singular verb after each, neither, everyone, everybody, nobody, someone, and each.

E.g.
- Nobody is here
- Everybody helps when there is a crisis
### **Rule #3**: If you use <u>either-or</u>, not only....but also, and neither...nor, look at the subject closet to the verb.

E.g.
- Either Miss Brown or <u>Jane</u> writes on the blackboard.
- Either the teacher or <u>the students</u> write on the blackboard.
- Not only Julie but also <u>Georgette</u> wants to visit grandma
- Neither the teacher nor the students write on the blackboard.

### **Rule #4**: When using as well as, except, in addition to, no less than, and with, the noun before these phrases determines the number.

E.g. 
- My problem with you is you don't listen!
- Ford in addition to Mercedes Benz is lowering it's car prices to encourage better sales.
- The students in addition to the teacher are all receiving special recognition for their excellent research.

### Rule #5: Measure
