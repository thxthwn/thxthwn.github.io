**1. How do we learn about Masculinity and Femininity?**
	We often learn things through imitating others, same applies to how individual learns how to be masculine or feminine, for example, family members, peers, the media, etc.
**2. Do you think than gender roles will continue to change in the future?**
	Gender roles have been changing from the past, and I do think that gender roles will continue to change and develop in the future due to new ideas like equality, women's rights, etc.
**3. How have the gender roles changed (meaning, how have your parents' or grandparents' generation.)**
	People in my grandparents generation had a life with traditional gender roles, women tend to stay at home, seen as a homemaker, caregivers, and helpers. and Men are seen as dominant, leader, and protector
	
	Nowadays Individuals' lives are dramatically different those of their parents and grandparents. People are making choices that will prepare them for longer lives, getting more education.
