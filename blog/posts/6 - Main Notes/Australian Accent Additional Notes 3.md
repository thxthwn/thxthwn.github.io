1. Aboriginal English
2. Standard Australian
3. Ethnocultural Australian English
	- This one reflects that everyone has an idiolect — your own accent is shaped by where we’ve lived and who we’ve grown up with. 

Common traits
1. Speak with an open mouth
2. Rising statement — the High Rising Terminal (Uptalk)
3.  singy-sangy flow
4. lack of enunciation
