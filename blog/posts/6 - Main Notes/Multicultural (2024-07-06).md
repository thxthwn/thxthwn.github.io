## Is Language a Property of the Individual or the Group?
Language is a tool *only* used by humans for communication. A language is carried down via heritage and utilized and shared within a group. however, it does not imply that the community owns it legally.  
  
Mandarin is the most widely spoken language in China and its official language. The language has existed for almost eight centuries. By 2021, more than 940 million people are able to communicate in Mandarin. However, some individuals speak the language as a second language (L2).

Another example is a subset of English known as African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is spoken by members of specific communities, such as the African-American community. Although they still do not own the language, African-Americans still own the community. Being outside of the community and using the language is regarded as inappropriate, offensive, or racist.

some AAVE Grammatical points are different from Standard American English. For Example, adding the verbal -s not just on third-person singular verbs in the present tense such as in [Standard American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American_English "General American English"), but also added onto infinitives, first-person present verbs, and third-person past perfect verbs.

- He can goes out.
- I don't know how to gets no girls.
- He'd knows that.

A language can also be used in a certain group or community other than those based of nationality and ethnicity, such as generation groups. Generation Alpha has some vocabularies that only Gen Alpha uses such as: Ohio - This word is originally a name of a state in the US But in Generation Alpha Sociolect its meaning something bad or negative. Another example is the word "Rizz" - short for charisma, meaning an ability to charm and woo a person. 

AAVE and Slangs used by the alpha generation is something called a **Sociolect**, a form of language or a set of lexical items used by a socioeconomic class, profession, age group, or other social group.
