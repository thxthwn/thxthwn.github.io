## Overview
Australian English is the set of varieties of the English language native to Australia. Although Australia has no official language, the language is spoken by the majority of Australian people (72% of Australians as of 2021)<sup><font color="#0070c0">1</font></sup>. Australian English began to diverge from Irish English after People from [Britain](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain "Britain") and [Ireland](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland") first came to live in Australia in 1788

Australia has a diverse culture derived from it's Indigenous, British, and migrant influences. Many Australians identify egalitarianism, [mateship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateship "Mateship"), irreverence and a lack of formality as part of their [national identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identity "National identity")<sup><font color="#0070c0">2, 3, 4</font></sup> These find expression in [Australian slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_slang "Australian slang"), as well as [Australian humour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_comedy "Australian comedy"), which is often characterized as dry, irreverent and 
ironic.

Australians take pride in their accent, which often reflects their casual, friendly, and egalitarian social attitudes. The Australian English accent is often perceived as relaxed, with a tendency to shorten words (e.g., "afternoon" becomes "arvo," "barbecue" becomes "barbie").
## Linguistic features
The most obvious way in which Australian English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation.

### **Vowels**
 Australian English is known for its vowel shifts. For example, the vowel in words like "trap" /æ/ is more open and forward compared to British English, while "fleece" /iː/ is raised, sounding closer to /ɪi/.
     - Example: "cat" sounds closer to "caht."
   - Diphthongs (เสียงทุ้ม): Some diphthongs are more centralized or flattened. For instance, the diphthong in "face" is often realized as something closer to /æɪ/.
     - Example: "mate" can sound like "mite" in Australian English.
   - Non-rhotic (การไม่ออกเสียง /r/) : Like British English, Australian English is non-rhotic, meaning that the /r/ sound is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel.
     - Example: "car" is pronounced as /kaː/.
   - T-voicing: The /t/ between vowels is often flapped or voiced, making it sound closer to /d/.
     - Example: "butter" sounds like "budder."

### **Grammatical Features**
   - Use of Present Perfect Tense: Similar to British English, Australians often use the present perfect tense when Americans would use the simple past.
     Example: "I've just eaten" vs. the American "I just ate."
   - Tag Questions: Tag questions are frequently used, often with "isn't it?" or "eh?"
     Example: "It’s a nice day, isn’t it?"
   - Informal Use of "but": "But" is often placed at the end of sentences for emphasis in informal speech.
     Example: "It was a good movie, but."

 4. Intonation and Stress (เสียงสูงต่ำและการกดเสียง)
   - High Rising Terminal *เสียงท้าย* (HRT): One of the most recognized features of Australian English is the "high rising terminal" or "uptalk," where statements are often made with rising intonation, making them sound like questions.
     Example: "I went to the store yesterday?"
   - Reduced Stress: Certain syllables are reduced or omitted altogether in informal speech.
     Example: "probably" is often pronounced as "prolly" or "probly."

5. Regional Variations (ความหลากหลายทางภูมิภาค)
   While Australia has fewer regional dialect distinctions than other English-speaking countries, some minor differences exist:
   - South Australia: In this region, some vowels are more rounded, and older South Australians may use British terms like "front room" instead of "living room."
   - Queensland and New South Wales: More rural areas in these states may exhibit stronger accents with more exaggerated vowel sounds.

## Influences from other languages and cultures
### **1. Historical and Colonial Influences**
   - British and Irish Roots: The foundation of Australian English lies in the varieties of English spoken by British settlers, particularly from the early convicts and free settlers who came from different parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland. The language was influenced by the mixing of regional British dialects, leading to a somewhat homogenized version of English that laid the groundwork for Australian pronunciation and grammar.
     - Phonological influence: Australian English developed similar vowel shifts and non-rhotic features (where /r/ is dropped at the end of syllables) from dialects in southern England, particularly London and southeast regions, which were rhotically non-pronounced.
     - Irish Influence: The high rising terminal (HRT), or "uptalk," is often attributed to Irish immigrants. Irish speakers of English are known for similar rising intonations, and the Irish population had a significant presence in Australia, particularly in the 19th century.
   - Cockney and London Influence: Many early settlers were from London, particularly Cockney-speaking areas. This influence led to features such as the flapping of /t/ to /d/ (e.g., "butter" as "budder") and the flattening of diphthongs (e.g., "face" sounding like "fice").

### **2. Indigenous Language Influence**
   - Lexical Borrowings: Some vocabulary in Australian English comes from indigenous Australian languages, especially in relation to flora, fauna, and place names. For example, words like "kangaroo," "boomerang," and "billabong" were borrowed from Aboriginal languages.
   - Lack of Phonological Influence: Unlike many colonial languages that are heavily influenced by the local native languages, the phonological structure of Australian English has remained largely unaffected by indigenous Australian languages. This is due in part to the limited integration of indigenous communities with European settlers in the early years of colonization.

### **3. Social and Cultural Evolution**
   - Australian Identity: The evolution of Australian English was influenced by a desire to form a distinct identity, separate from the British colonial past. This led to the development of slang, diminutives, and informal speech that characterize Australian English today. The use of abbreviations (e.g., "arvo" for afternoon, "servo" for service station) is part of this laid-back, egalitarian Australian ethos.
     - The emphasis on egalitarianism in Australian culture may also explain the relatively informal nature of the language, even in formal contexts. This can be traced back to Australia's origins as a penal colony, where the class structures of Britain were less rigid, and there was less deference to hierarchy in speech.
   - World Wars and American Influence: Although Australian English started off being closely aligned with British English, the influence of American English increased, particularly after World War II, when American soldiers were stationed in Australia. This led to the adoption of certain Americanisms in vocabulary, such as "truck" (instead of "lorry") and "elevator" (though "lift" is still common).

### **4. Development of Phonological Features**
   - Vowel Shift and Flattening: The distinctive vowel pronunciations in Australian English (e.g., "mate" sounding like "mite") are thought to have originated from a leveling effect as people from different British dialect regions intermingled in early colonial Australia. The distinct Australian accent emerged as settlers blended their accents into a relatively homogenous speech community, a process that took about 50 years. 
   - Non-rhotic Accent: The loss of the rhotic /r/ sound in Australian English mirrors similar patterns seen in southern British dialects, particularly from the London area, which were prominent in the early settler populations.
   - T-voicing (flapping): The tendency to voice the /t/ sound as a /d/ in certain positions (e.g., "butter" becoming "budder") likely stems from Cockney English and other dialects spoken by early London settlers. This feature was reinforced and became a defining feature of Australian English over time.

### **5. Lexical Features and Slang**
   - Australian Slang and Diminutives: The use of diminutives (e.g., "brekkie" for breakfast, "bikkie" for biscuit) has cultural origins. Australians often value casualness and simplicity, and this is reflected in their language. Diminutives give a sense of familiarity and ease. The habit of abbreviating words is also seen as a reflection of the egalitarian nature of Australian society, where people try to avoid sounding too formal or pompous.
   - Cultural Attitudes: Phrases like "no worries" and "she'll be right" reflect a cultural attitude of optimism and resilience in the face of challenges. This laid-back attitude is often seen as central to the Australian character, influenced by the harsh environment and challenges of life in early colonial Australia.

### **6. Changes Over Time**
   - Increased American Influence: Over time, the increasing influence of American culture (through television, movies, and commerce) has led to the gradual adoption of more Americanisms in Australian English, particularly among younger generations.
   - Decline of Britishisms: While British vocabulary and pronunciation were dominant in the early 20th century, there has been a decline in the use of British terms and forms. For example, "cookie" is now often used alongside "biscuit," and younger Australians are more likely to refer to "pants" instead of "trousers."
   - Urban vs. Rural Accents: In modern Australia, the more noticeable differences in accents tend to occur between urban and rural areas, rather than between states or regions. Urban Australians tend to have a milder accent, whereas rural Australians may retain broader features, such as stronger vowel sounds and greater use of idiomatic expressions.
	## Slang words, vocabularies, and phrases
### **1. Arvo (Afternoon)**
- **Etymology**: The word “arvo” is a typical example of Australian English's tendency to shorten words and add an "-o" ending. It dates back to the early 20th century.
- **Origin**: Likely derived from British English, as Australians inherited the habit of abbreviation from British slang. Australians tend to abbreviate common words to make casual conversation easier and quicker.

### **2. G'day (Good day)**
- **Etymology**: “G’day” is a contraction of "good day," a common greeting in Australia.
- **Origin**: The phrase comes from the British settlers’ use of “good day” as a greeting, which was then shortened for casual use over time. The use of “g’day” as a greeting became widespread in the mid-20th century.

### **3. Mate (Friend)**
- **Etymology**: The word "mate" comes from Old English "mæġ," meaning kin or friend.
- **Origin**: While “mate” is used in British English, it became more significant in Australian English due to the strong emphasis on "mateship" in Australian culture, which symbolizes camaraderie, loyalty, and mutual respect.

### **4. Barbie (Barbecue)**
- **Etymology**: “Barbie” is a shortened form of "barbecue," a word that originates from the Spanish “barbacoa,” referring to a method of cooking meat over an open flame.
- **Origin**: The term “barbie” likely emerged in the mid-20th century as Australians adopted the abbreviation habit. Barbecuing is a popular social activity in Australia due to the climate and outdoor culture.

### **5. Fair Dinkum (Genuine, true)**
- **Etymology**: The phrase “fair dinkum” means honest or genuine. The origin of “dinkum” is debated, but it likely comes from British dialects or Chinese workers in the goldfields of Australia in the 19th century.
- **Origin**: One theory is that "dinkum" was derived from a dialect in the Midlands of England, meaning "fair work" or "honest work." Another suggests it originated from the Chinese term "ding kam" (meaning "true gold"), reflecting the gold rush era.

### **6. Aussie (Australian)**
- **Etymology**: "Aussie" is a diminutive form of "Australian."
- **Origin**: The word "Aussie" reflects the tendency of Australians to abbreviate and colloquialize words, often adding the “-ie” or “-y” suffix to create affectionate terms. It has been in use since the early 20th century and is often pronounced with a soft “z” sound.

### **7. Bogan (Unsophisticated person)**
- **Etymology**: The exact origins of the word "bogan" are unclear, but it is thought to have emerged in the 1980s in Australia, likely as a derogatory term for people from rural or working-class backgrounds.
- **Origin**: The term "bogan" may have come from place names like "Bogan Shire" in New South Wales, though this is speculative. It has since become a widely recognized term used both humorously and insultingly to describe someone perceived as uncultured or unsophisticated.

### **8. Servo (Service station)**
- **Etymology**: "Servo" is a shortened form of "service station."
- **Origin**: Like many Australian abbreviations, "servo" likely originated in the mid-20th century as a casual, colloquial term for gas stations. It reflects the common habit of shortening everyday terms for convenience.

### **9. Esky (Portable cooler)**
- **Etymology**: "Esky" is actually a brand name that became synonymous with portable coolers in Australia.
- **Origin**: The term comes from the brand “Eskimo,” which was shortened to “Esky.” It became widely used due to the popularity of the brand for picnics and barbecues. The name likely plays on the cold connotations of the term “Eskimo.”

### **10. Ripper (Great, excellent)**
- **Etymology**: “Ripper” is derived from British English, where the word "rip" means something sharp or excellent.
- **Origin**: The term was adopted in Australian slang in the 19th century, taking on the meaning of something fantastic or top-notch. It's often used in phrases like “You beauty, that’s a ripper!”

### **11. Cuppa (Cup of tea)**
- **Etymology**: "Cuppa" is a shortened form of "cup of," generally referring to tea or coffee.
- **Origin**: This slang likely originated from British English, where tea drinking is a central cultural activity. Australians adopted the phrase and it remains a common way to invite someone for tea or coffee.

### **12. Larrikin (Rebellious or mischievous person)**
- **Etymology**: “Larrikin” is thought to come from British or Irish dialect, possibly derived from the Irish word "larkin," meaning playful.
- **Origin**: It became widely used in the 19th century to describe people who flouted social norms, often with a cheeky or mischievous attitude. Larrikinism is a key part of the Australian self-image, reflecting a rebellious and fun-loving streak.
