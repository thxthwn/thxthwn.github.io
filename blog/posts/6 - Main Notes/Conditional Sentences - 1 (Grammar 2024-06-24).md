****

## Conditional Sentences

**Contditional Sentences**, also known as "If-Clause" are used to talk about things that might happen, things that you'd like to happen, and things that you wish had happened.

A conditional sentence consists of 2 clauses; 'If clause' & 'Main clause'

**Example**

> - If it rains tomorrow, the match will be cancelled.

	If it rains tomorrow,
This is the 'If clause' 

This sole sentence is also =='Incomplete' & 'Dependent'.== It must be conjugating with another sentence.

	the match will be cancelled.
This is the 'Main clause'

Both clauses are **interchangable**, meaning their places can be swapped.
