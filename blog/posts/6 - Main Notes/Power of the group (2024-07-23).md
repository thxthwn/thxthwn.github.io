## Friends influences me more than my family.

**Reason 1:** Emotional Resonance
	Supporting: Friends often share similar life experiences.
	Objection: Family can also offer emotional support
		Objection: Family members may offer support, but the specific, shared experiences and interests of friends can make their support feel more personally relevant.
**Reason 2:** Non-judgmental
	Supporting: Being non-judgmental encourages vulnerability, builds trust, reduces conflict
		Objection: - Friends might worry that being non-judgmental could lead to enabling unhealthy behaviors. They may feel conflicted between offering support and encouraging personal responsibility.
	Objection - Family members can also be non-judgmental
**Reason 3:** Frequency of Interaction
	Supporting: People spend time with their peers more than their family.
	Supporting: Friends Give Immediate Feedback
		Objection: Family influence can also be immediate. Family members are often present during key moments and can offer real-time influence and support in important decisions or crises.
			Objection: While family influence is immediate, the informal and frequent nature of friendsâ€™ interactions often allows for more spontaneous and less structured influence, which can feel more immediate and impactful.
**Objection 1:** Parental Guidance
	Supporting: Parents often have deeper and long-term understanding of their children's history, goals, and values
		Objection: Friends offer immediate and contextually relevant advice that reflects current trends and peer experiences, which might be more applicable in certain situations than long-term parental guidance.
