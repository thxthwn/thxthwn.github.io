# Reported Speech (2024-07-03 class) (2024-07-14 written)
Reported speech is when we tell someone what another person said. To do this, we can use direct speech or indirect speech.

Example:

> direct speech: "I ==work== in a bank" said Daniel.
> Indirect speech (Reported speech): Daniel said he ==worked== in a bank.

In indirect speech, we often use a tense which is 'further back' in the past (e.g.Â ==_worked_==) than the tense originally used (e.g.Â _work_). This is called 'backshift'. We also may need to change other words that were used, for example pronouns.

### Forming a Reported Speech
When using reported speech; 
- Change the pronoun depending on who the speaker is.
- Report what the person said by using "said (that)" or "told + (Object) + (that)" For example:

- Josh said (that)
- Jaden told Jude (that)

The present form in direct speech changes to the past form in reported speech
- The verbs of the sentence are usually in past tense.
- The rest will usually be in the past too.

am/is = was
are = were
do/does = did
will = would
have/has = had
can = could

We can also use verbs like say, said, remark, told, tell, add, explain, show, etc.
