# Cognition v Metacognition

Cognition is the process of thinking, knowing and taking an information, make sense and meaning out of that information through a process of organizing that information.

Examples of Cognitive Approach:

- Homework/Classwork
- Listening Activites
- Reading
- Problem Solving
- Discussions

Metacognition is thinking about one's own thinking and learning processes. It involves planning, monitoring, and assessing one's understanding and performance

The key is explicitly teaching students to plan, monitor, and evaluate their own thinking and learning processes, rather than just focusing on the subject matter.

Examples of Metacognitive approach:

- Preassessments - Encouraging Students to Examine their current thinking; "What do I already know about this topic tht could guide my learning?"
- Retrospective Post-assessments - Pushing students to recognize conceptual change; "Before this course, I thought x was... Now I think that x is..."
- Reflective Journals - Providing a forum in which students monitor their own thinking; "What about my exam preparation worked well that I should remember to do next time? What did not work so well that I should not do next time or that I should change?"
