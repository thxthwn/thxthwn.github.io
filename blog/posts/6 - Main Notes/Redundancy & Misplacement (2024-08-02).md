# Redundancy
**Redundancy** <span style="background:#fff88f">means using words unnecessarily or repeating words.</span>

>If all of us cooperate together, we will...

In this sentence, the words cooperate together and have been used. But these words have the same meaning.

One of the two words can be dropped to avoid redundancy.
- If all of us <span style="background:#fff88f">cooperate</span>, we will...
- If all of us <span style="background:#fff88f">work together</span>, we will...

## Misplaced Modifiers
A misplaced or dangling modifier is **a word or phrase that modifies a word not clearly stated in the sentence**

A modifier should be placed next to the word it describes.

>John lifted the ==heavy== box ==containing supplies.==
- "Heavy" modifies box
- "Containing supplies" modifies box
### Types of misplaced modifiers
**1. Adjectives & Adverbs** 
Misplaced adjectives are **incorrectly separated from the nouns they modify and almost always distort the intended meaning**. Correct the error by placing the adjective next to the noun it modifies

>**Misplaced:** He <span style="background:#fff88f">nearly</span> lost nearly all of his money in a day.
>**Corrected:** He lost nearly all of his money in a day.

**2. Participial Phrases**
Emphasize that participial phrases should be immediately next to the nouns they modify to avoid suggesting that another element is performing the action.

>**Misplaced:** Running down the street,<span style="background:#fff88f"> her hat</span> fell off. <span style="background:#fff88f">(suggesting that the hat is running down the street.)</span>
>**Corrected:** Running down the street, <span style="background:#fff88f">she</span> lost her hat.
(ประโยคเต็มก็คือ Who is running down the street.)

**3. Infinitive phrases** 
Point out that infinitive phrases need to be close to the nouns they modify, to avoid altering the intended meaning.

>**Misplaced:** To improve her English,<span style="background:#fff88f"> her books</span> were all read in the original language (She wrote the book?)
>**Corrected:** To improve her English, <span style="background:#fff88f">she</span> read all her books in the original language (She owned books.)

**4. Relative clauses** 

>**Misplaced:** She sold the car than was <span style="background:#fff88f">nearly new</span> to the buyer. (the buyer felt the car was nearly new, but others doesn't?)
>**Corrected:** She sold the <span style="background:#fff88f">nearly new</span> car to a buyer.
