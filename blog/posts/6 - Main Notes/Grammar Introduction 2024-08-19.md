# The stories and dreams

Greetings! I'm Thawin Yamkasikorn, or you can call me by my nicknames, Theme and Theo. I was born and grew up in Bangkok, went to primary school at Chokchai School, then I started middle school at Striwittaya 2 school, but I had to move to Roi Et when I was starting Matthayom 5, So I graduated high school from Strisuksa, Roi Et.

Currently I am studying in the TESOL program, Faculty of Education, Khon Kaen University. I chose this path of becoming an English teacher because I personally like the English language, I wanted to share my knowledge in English to future students and other people, and also raising awareness on the Importance of using English language in society is also one of my goals.

In the future, I am looking forward to be teaching in the higher education field, which is teaching ==in== a university. I believe there is no end to learning.
