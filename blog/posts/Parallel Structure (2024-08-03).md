# Parallel Structure (2024-08-03)
**Parallel structure** is a repetition of a grammatical form within a sentence
- making each compared item or idea follow the same grammatical pattern
## Parallel Structure in Single Word Form
- Use only one word.
- In the same part of speech.
- Using the same tense.

E.g.
- My father was an officer, <u>a gentleman, and a magician.</u> (nouns)
- He studied<u>,thought, and experimented.</u> (verbs, past participle)
- The young actor was tall,<u>dark, and handsome.</u> (adjectives)
- Late for the dance, Ruth dressed<u>hastily and carelessly.</u> (adverbs)
- They waited for hours at the airport, <u>reading and sleeping.</u> (verbs, Present Continuous Participle)

Examples of Sentences not following the parallel structure.
- Ashley likes to ski, to swim and<font color="#c00000"> <u>to jump.</u></font> (Not Parallel)
- Ashley likes to ski, to swim and <font color="#00b050"><u>jumping</u>. </font>(Parallel)
- Joe likes singing, walking and <font color="#00b050"><u>diving</u></font> (Parallel)
- Joe likes singing, walking and<font color="#ff0000"> <u>to dive</u>.</font> (Not Parallel)

## Parallel Structure in Phrase Form\
Parallel structure should be used to balance a series of phrases with the same grammatical structure. (e.g. noun phrase, prepositional phrases, verbal phrases.)

E.g. 
**Avoid mixing noun phrases with verb phrases.**
- Initial trials showed that exposure to the chemical caused<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"> memory problems,</span> <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">intermittent dizziness</span>, and <span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)">deters sleep.</span> (Not Parallel, "deters sleep" is a verbal phrase.)
- Initial trials showed that exposure to the chemical caused <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">memory problems,</span> <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">intermittent dizziness</span>, and <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">insomnia.</span> (Parallel)
**Do not mix phrases based on an infinitive with phrases based on gerunds (V.ing).**
- Her main duties were <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">answering phone calls</span>, <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">filing records</span>, and to <span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)">conduct visitor surveys.</span> (Not Parallel, "Conduct visitor surveys" is an infinitive phrase.)
- Her main duties were <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">answering phone calls</span>,<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"> filing records,</span> and<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"> conducting visitor surveys.</span> (Parallel)
**Do not mix prepositional phrases with clauses.**
- My teacher judged the essay <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">for parallelism</span>, <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">for style</span>, and <span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)">she looked for accuracy.</span> (Not parallel, "she looked for accuracy" is a clause.)
- My teacher judged the essay <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">for parallelism</span>, <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">for style</span>, and <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">for accuracy.</span> (Parallel)

## Parallel Structure in Clause Form
A parallel structure that begins with clauses must keep on with clauses.
1. Ensure the format of the first clause "parallels" (haha see what i did there) or maintained with the second clause
2. Ensure that the nouns, the adjectives, the adverbs, and the verb tenses parallels

**Types of clauses**
1. Main clause
2. Subordinate clause
3. Adjective clause
4. Noun clause

### Parallelism in Main Clause
> On last Monday, <u>the dog was barking</u> and <u>we were running</u>.

### Parallelism in Subordinate clause
> <u>When the teacher calls my name</u> or <u>when the class focuses on me</u>, I will extremely feel nervous.

### Parallelism in Adjective clause
> My dog Sally,<u>who loves pizza crusts</u>, eats them under the kitchen table, where she chews and drools with great enthusiasm

## 5 Parallelism Rules
1. Use parallel structure with elements joined by <span style="background:#fff88f">coordinating conjunctions</span>
	Using and, or, but, etc.
2. Use parallel structure with elements in <span style="background:#fff88f">lists</span> or in a series
	1. The last element in the series connecting to the others should have these coordinating conjunctions: and, or, but (not), or yet (not).
	2. Commas should be placed between each element
3. Use parallel structure with<span style="background:#fff88f"> elements being compared</span>.
	Using more, less, better, worse, etc.
4. Use parallel structure with elements joined by a<span style="background:#fff88f"> linking verb</span>
	E.g. What you see is what you get.
5. Use parallel structure with elements joined by a<span style="background:#fff88f"> correlative conjunction</span>
		either/or, neither/nor, both/and, not only/but also, etc.
