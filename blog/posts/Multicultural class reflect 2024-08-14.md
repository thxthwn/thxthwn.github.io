- **What are some things you learned from today’s session that you didn’t know before?**
	I've learned from today's session that people perceive the map of the world differently due to cultural, educational background, and personal experience, for instance, Some Americans might draw the map placing their continent in the middle, splitting Eurasia apart because they've grown up with the said map, while the rest of the world is more used to the Mercator projection with the Western hemisphere on the left. Another Instance is the Chinese vertical world map, due to China's view on their own country as the "Central Nation." China is placed at the center of the map and other countries is spread out.
	I also learned about the term "cultural lens", it is simply the unique perspective each of us forms due to the cultural conditioning we receive from our groups. In other words, it is the inevitable result of living in an environment, absorbing the culture, and accepting it as ours.
- **What were some things that you knew before?**
	 Due to cultural differences, people view the world in different ways. For instance, Italians pinch their fingers to convey their emotions during conversations. It's possible that non-Italians won't get why Italians make the hand gesture.
	
	Another example is social distancing. While standing directly next to someone may not seem out of place in some countries, such as the Arab world, many other cultures view this as disrespectful.
- **What is your perspective?**
	We all have different perspectives because of our varied cultural backgrounds, experiences, and educational experiences, in my opinion and from what I've learned in today's session. It is crucial that we avoid viewing things through biased lenses.
